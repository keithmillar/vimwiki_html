<p>
I used to capture all kinds of information about what I read, but I found that I almost never used it. I used to categorize and classify the books, and break them into fiction and nonfiction, and the gender of the author. But I never used it. So I simplified things in the text file. Today, I capture just a few pieces of information:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
 Title

<li>
 Author

<li>
 Date completed

</ul>

<p>
I have a few symbols I use after the title which indicate information useful to me:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
= a book I really liked, and would recommend.
<br />    @ = audiobook
<br />    + = e-book
<br />    ^ = a repeated reading (that is, I have read the book more than once).

</ul>

<p>
This turns out to be enough information, and to satisfy most of the questions I have about my reading list and reading habits.
</p>

<p>
<span id="What I track about my reading-All of the books I’ve read in 2014"></span><strong id="All of the books I’ve read in 2014">All of the books I’ve read in 2014</strong>
</p>

<p>
At the command line, I simply type:
</p>

<p>
grep 2014 reading.txt
</p>

<p>
<span id="What I track about my reading-The number of books I read in 2014"></span><strong id="The number of books I read in 2014">The number of books I read in 2014</strong>
</p>

<p>
Ah, but what if I want to know the number of books I read without needed to see the full list? I can type,
grep 2014 reading.txt | wc -l
The wc -l at the end filters the output through the word count (wc) command and gets the number of lines in the results. Since I have one line per book the resulting number is the number of books in the query:
</p>

<p>
<span id="What I track about my reading-How many Stephen King books have I read?"></span><strong id="How many Stephen King books have I read?">How many Stephen King books have I read?</strong>
</p>

<p>
Regular readers know that I am a big fan of Stephen King. So how many times have I read Stephen King?
</p>

<p>
grep "Stephen King" reading.txt | wc -l
</p>

<p>
<span id="What I track about my reading-How many Stephen King books have I read more than once?"></span><strong id="How many Stephen King books have I read more than once?">How many Stephen King books have I read more than once?</strong>
</p>

<p>
This one is only slightly more complicated. To get the answer, I run this command:
</p>

<p>
grep "Stephen King" reading.txt | grep -F ^ | wc -l
</p>

<p>
Which basically says, “Search for the term ‘Stephen King’ in reading.txt, and then take the results and search for the ^ symbol, which is my designator for a re-read, and finally count the resulting lines.
</p>

<p>
The number of times I’ve re-read Stephen King books is 16.
</p>

<p>
To see the actual books I’ve re-read, I can just leave off the final line count search, and do this:
</p>

<p>
grep "Stephen King" reading.txt | grep -F ^
</p>

<p>
<span id="What I track about my reading-When was the last time I read an Isaac Asimov book?"></span><strong id="When was the last time I read an Isaac Asimov book?">When was the last time I read an Isaac Asimov book?</strong>
</p>

<p>
For that I can use the UNIX tail command:
</p>

<p>
grep "Isaac Asimov" reading.txt | tail -n1
</p>

<p>
This simply returns all of the lines from my reading list that match “Isaac Asimov” and then looks at just the last line in the results (that’s what the tail -n1 does). The last time I finished an Isaac Asimov book was on April 24, 2012. You can also see what the book was
