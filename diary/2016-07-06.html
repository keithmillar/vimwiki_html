Drove back from Saint John via Saint Georges and arrived in time to meet Garth,
so he was able to use his pc instead of the hotels.

Flo and I wandered around the Hotel and Down Town to the Red Herring where we
sampled the local Beer.

Garth and Helena took Flo and myself to the Golf Club for a Birthday meal massive
plate of Mussels for a starter and fish and chips for a main course.
