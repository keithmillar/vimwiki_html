Set off on the MTB's and found the house we liked last week, only 3 mile from Altury. Still looks nice, even better to day as the sun was shining, continued on to Montroy and Isabels for our coffee. We where able to cycle through the valley to Altury from the roads that we can see from the tower in Montroy.

Lovely evening, dined al fresco and enjoyed a few glasses of vino in the garden.
