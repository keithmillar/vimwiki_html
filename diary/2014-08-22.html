Arrived at the airport with sufficient time for an easy check in although the place was busier than we expected due probably to it being a bank holiday, any all went smoothly and we collect luggage and hire car with minimal fuss and we where on our way.

Our first port of call was Valencia airport to pick up Mairead, then Turis to the shops for some necessary food and beer.

We where lucky with dark clear skys and watched the ISS pass over head from the bar in Altury.
