Canoeing on the Kennebecasis River today. Hired a car as G&amp;H have a lot going on
today including a T.T tonight in Hampton so to take the pressure off us we got a
car for the day at a cost of \(80 and \)9 fuel well worth it.
</p>

<p>
During the course of our trip we spotted Bald Eagles, Osprey, Red-striped
Blackbirds, Musk Rats and an array of dragon flys, not to mention the blood
sucking flies.

<p>
Drove to Kingston for coffee and cake after a lunch in Kredlâ€™s Market then back
to Hampton for the start of the 20km T.T.
</p>

<p>
Started my warm up the temp was 28.9 fell slightly over the course of the
evening, but it was the wind which caused the most problems. Did a not too bad
time considering I was on a borrowed CX bike.
</p>

<p>
We went back to The Pretentious Pig for a drink, with Garth, Helena, Darrell &amp;
Ellen, mainly to discuss the up coming Ireland Trip.
