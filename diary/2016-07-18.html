 A Foggy drive to Blacks Harbour and a longer Foggy boat ride to Grand Manan.
</p>
 
<p>
 After an early start we were all gasping for coffee when the boat docked we
 made a bee line for the first coffee shop we could find, the aromas when we
 opened the door where promising but we where told that this was a Roasting
 House and they couldn't sell coffee, so back on the road we went.
</p>
 
<p>
 We ended up at the far end of the Island and no coffee, but it was decided we
 need a walk so a short very slippy walk was undertaken but was soon abandoned
 as it was too slippy under foot.
</p>
 
<p>
 Driving back we stopped at Food for Thought for some very nice sandwiches
 although what we ordered and what we got where two different things.
</p>
 
<p>
 We then explored some of the fascinating Light House and because the weather was
 so poor we changed to an earlier boat home.
