Brilliant road from Dos Aguas to Bicor, first part through a deep river valley including a nice 2+ mile descent then a load of climbing until the descent into Bicor, from here to Sumacarrer was pretty up and down. The plan was to meet Flo here and cycle on through Tous and back to Alturu but there was no way from Tous to Sumacarrcer by this time I was very hot so we decided to call it a day and I came home with Flo in the car. The Spanish really need to sort out their maps and signage.
