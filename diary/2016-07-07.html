Looks like kzone is off line ?
</p>

<p>
Heading off to St Sephen to collect a truck and the load it with 300 bottles of
water.
</p>

<p>
Well that didn't go according to plan, collected truck after a little trouble
finding Border Transmissions however when we went to Atlantic for the water we
discovered that it was never ordered so we are now waiting for the water to
arrive either Friday evening or Saturday Morning.
</p>

<p>
Garth and I unloaded the truck and setup the room for the volunteer night and
checked out the swim course.
</p>

<p>
The volunteer night was interesting in that we had a massive Thunder storm over
head just after Garth's presentation.
