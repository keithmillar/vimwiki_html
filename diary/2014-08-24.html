Today's route didn't go as planned got lost all most as soon as we left Altury, and we ended up riding on the CV50 more than I wanted to. After buying a map in L'Alcudia we were able to pick our way slightly better, although we still had one major detour on the way to Picasent, once we got to Picasent we picked up the road to Turis and back to Altury. All our messing about cost us an extra 15 miles in 43c heat.

Half way round the Bottom bracket in the Cannondale started to complain big time so we will have to locate a supplier before any more cycling.
