La Vuelta - Albarcete
</p>

<p>
Today we drove to Albarcete for a stage of La Vuelta. It was a 2.5hr drive with great scenery although we decided on a more direct route home. 
</p>

<p>
We got parked about 1km from the stage finish and after lunch we staked out our place just on the 50 mtrs to go sign. We watched the last 35km on a big screen and took as many free bees from the cavalcade as we could, the riders flashed by in a blur, with Nasa Buhama taking the win. On the way back to the car we got his photo and Flo also got Dan Martins.
